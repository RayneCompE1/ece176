### Sequential Display

This project requires the student to design and implement a circuit that takes a 4-bit input bus and converts it to decimal, then display the decimal value on two 7-segment displays. The design should include a twos compliment input, which enables the circuit to represent the 4-bit integer in twos compliment.
